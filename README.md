# Lucas Kanade Tracker
This is a coursework project for ENPM673: Perception for Autonomous Robots in which we implemented Lucas-Kanade template tracker.

## Overview
Implementation of Lucas-Kanade (LK) template tracker on three video sequences from the Visual Tracker benchmark database: featuring a car on the road, a baby fighting a dragon and Usain Boltâ€™s race. Also, the video's contrast is enhanced and robustness of the tracker is tested on car on the road video.
